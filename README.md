# TRCMobileApp
This is a mobile application for our intramural running club. It's main features include: 
Being able to vote on each day's route (in progress), A Map that shows all of our routes, 
a news feed showing recent posts from our social media accounts (in progress), and other
resources such as our schedule, and info on how to become a member. To view the code for
the project, click on the 'Texas Running' folder. 

Language: Swift 

Frameworks Used: Apple MapKit, Apple WebKit, TwitterKit

API's Used: Strava API (In Progress)

NOTE: If attempting to recreate this app, you will need to register for a Twitter Developer
Account, create an App in your Twitter Dev Account (this doesn't actually obligate you to
make an app), and from there obtain your Consumer API Keys. Then in the AppDelegate.Swift
file, replace keys.TwitterKey and keys.TwitterSecret with your keys.
